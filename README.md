👋 Hi, I’m Warren Villarosa!

I am an NDT Level 3 specialist with programming and data analytics skills. I'm based in Perth, Western Australia

I started my programming and data journey in early 2019 with some online courses via Udemy. I took the plunge into a bootcamp in 2020 where I learned how to program in VBA, 
Python, Javascript and R. I also learned some SQL through using Postgres and noSQL databases using MongoDB and JSON. I also further honed my HTML skills (first gained from
the days of personal sites on Asian Avenue and Myspace) and lerned to develop online dashboards and web applications. By the end of the 6 month bootcamp I had also learned
how to create basic machine learning models. I enjoyed my learning so much that I am now currently studying a Bachelor of Data Analytics at UniSA while I work and develop
the skills I gained in the data analytics bootcamp.

👀 I’m interested in everything data! In paticular I'd like to get competent enough to work with Artificial Neural Networks, particularly in Image and Signal processing. 

🌱 I’m currently learning, the ins and outs of Python. I blazed through it previously and felt I needed more focus onm the fundamentals.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NDT simulation, Image processing and Signal processing projects. Happy to do grunt work if someone is happy to teach.
